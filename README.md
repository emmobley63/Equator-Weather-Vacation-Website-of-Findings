Web-Design-Challenge
I wanted to create a website for the graphs and findings of our Coordinates vs Climate analysis. I built the table using  used bootstrap containers and navbars to create a pleasing asthetic. 

The navabar was pulled from the bootstrap library and then adjusted to be "centered-right." I used the hamburger-icon when the screen was below the "md" size of pixels. I also changed the brand logo to be bold and white.
